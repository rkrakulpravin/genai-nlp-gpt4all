# genai-nlp-gpt4all
An intelligent and scalable NLP solution that leverages GPT4All and RAG to efficiently validate provider eligibility, integrating local LLM inference with structured data for fast, context-aware results.

# Generative AI NLP with GPT4All

This project demonstrates a simple natural language processing (NLP) application built using an open-source large language model (LLM), GPT4All.

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Parses user input using a custom prompt template
- Generates contextually relevant responses using a local GPT4All model
- Demonstrates basic prompt handling and output generation for NLP tasks

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- GPT4All
- Transformers / LLM APIs
- (Optional) Streamlit/Flask (if UI used)

## ðŸ›  How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `genai_nlp_gpt4all.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Follow the cells step-by-step to load the model and generate output

## ðŸ“š Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of prompt engineering
- Explore capabilities and limitations of local LLMs
- Practice building simple GenAI applications

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
This was a personal learning project completed after a course on Udemy titled *"Generative AI for Beginners"*.
